# Shortcord
This is an extremely simple app that is designed to record audio when you press a combination of buttons, then stop when you press a different set of buttons. The name is a portmanteau of "Shortcut" and "Record"

# How to use
There is no fancy installer for this app, given that it was put together in an hour. So:

1. Unzip it to a location of your choice
2. Run shortcord.exe
3. The app will start minimized. Open it up, then minimize it again. It'll then get sent to the tray as a speaker icon
4. Press Windows + Caps Lock to start recording
5. Press Windows + Shift + Caps Lock to stop recording
6. Recordings are saved in your Documents folder.

Don't forget to remove them when you're done!

# Why was this app written?
It was written at the request of an acquaintance who was looking for a way to quickly record audio with just a shortcut key combo.

# Contributing
Help on this app would be good. I'd like a nicer icon, a set of options to pick the save destination, encryption options (to keep your recordings safe) and other stuff. If you can do these, fork and submit a pull request.
